# Setup
These instructions are for setting up the project on Linux or MacOS

## Create a Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with other python projects, we recommend you use a virtual environment

To create your virtual environment, open a terminal and navigate to directory where you cloned or downloaded the repo.

Then run
```bash
python -m venv .
```

To activate the virtual environment, run
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
