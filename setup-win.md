These instructions are for setting up the project on Windows

## Create a Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with other python projects, we recommend you use a virtual environment

To create your virtual environment, open a command line and navigate to directory where you cloned or downloaded the repo.

Then run
```commandline
python -m venv .
```

To activate the virtual environment, run
```commandline
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
